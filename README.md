## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first project using react to build out the site, I learned a lot more about javascript and utilzing the map and filter functions and how to structre a web app using components. The biggest struggle I encountered was preserving the data of the array after applying a filter. The article below help me understand how to conditionally render each filter and preserve the original array by maping over the array and apply the filter when it renders.

### Useful resources

- [Filtering and Conditonal Rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_filtering_conditional_rendering) - This helped me for understand how to implement the filtering on the array.
